I love blogging so much, because when the first time I know the Internet, I start to create a blog.

Well, now I am a Frontend Programmer, every day I open Visual Studio Code (Code Editor)
and I want to share with you what the most important to have in my VS Code:

- CodeSandbox Color Theme
- Dank Mono Font
